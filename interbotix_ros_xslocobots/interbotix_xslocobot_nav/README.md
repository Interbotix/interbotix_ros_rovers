## Overview

This package configures the ROS Navigation Stack needed to give any X-Series Interbotix Locobot platform the ability to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (a.k.a SLAM), navigation, or just localization. It can be used with just the [Intel RealSense D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) camera or with both the camera and the [A2M8 RPLidar](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2) laser scanner. The localization and mapping part is done using the [rtabmap_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros) ROS package while the navigation part is accomplished via the [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) ROS package. For best results, this package should be run with the robot in an indoor, uncluttered environment that does not contain too much sunlight and has minimal reflective surfaces.
